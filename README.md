### Summary

This project is designed to parse the raw html from the USC COVID data page and convert it in a more usable csv. The end goal is to have the data in a way that it can be analyzerd to show a heatmap of covid hotspots on campus over time using either built in python data visualization options such as geopandas, or 3rd party visualization suites such as CARTO.
